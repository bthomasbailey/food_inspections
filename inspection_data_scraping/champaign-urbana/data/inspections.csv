(Inspection done at breakfast, no hot holding).  NOTE: Per our discussion, the mop closet faucet needs attention.  This was NOT under pressure during inspection, so technically it was not a violation, and does not figure in to above inspection.  HOWEVER, in the interest of protecting the health of your staff and students, this issue needs to be addressed.  In question is the faucet at the mop sink. The faucet does have a ""mushroom valve"" or ""atmospheric vacuum breaker"" which is made to prevent backflow, but never designed to be under constant pressure.  The faucet arm also has a ""Y"" shaped connector attached, which has 2 shut-off valves to stop flow.  This design can allow the mushroom valve upstream to be under constant pressure, which can lead to its failure when needed most.  I would ask you to please either remove the ""Y"" connector completely,  or else install a backflow preventer between the faucet arm and the ""Y"" connector.  Thank you very much for your willingness to deal with this issue immediately, it is my understanding that maintenance is on the way to facility right away, even as this is being typed.If you have any questions, please call me at 373-7900."

Per our discussion, please remove and wash/rinse/sanitize the steam wand every 4 hours and at the end of each day.  In addition to the required 4-hour clean/rinse/sanitizing, the steam wand may also be wiped down. This can be wiped down with a clean dry cloth (the cloth must be changed every 2 hours) or the steam wand can be wiped down with a clean cloth kept in sanitizer of the proper concentration.  Also, the cheese cake spatula needs to either be refrigerated between uses or else replaced or washed/rinsed/sanitized every 4 hours.Keep up the good work!"
